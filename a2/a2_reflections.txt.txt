1. I used a combination of both strategies. Once I have an idea of what problems needed to be solved, I designed the loops in the main function like sub functions so that they can be tested easily.

2. Not too much plan was spent on design, the problem to be solved is not extremely complicated. My application was planned for the most part acceptabally well.
	One problem was unexpected: when reading example files, there were white space at the end of the txt file that resulted in empty lists, making the size of the array more than 9. 
	There were no functions that I need to create other than my main check_sudoku() function.
3. I estimated the implementaton stage to not take very long since I only have 1 main function after the read_file() function.
	What I estimated was roughly the same as the time I took to implement the different sections of my main function.
4. My test did not find errors in my functions after testing nor during the verificaion stage.
	I spend less time debugging than writting the function. It is easier to test when I was certain of the tasks each loop in the function. 
5. I have spent roughtly 6 hours in total to write the program and to implement the test driver. 
	For a novice coder like myself, it is roughtly what I expect, as it is easy for me to run into a problem and be stuck on it for some time.
