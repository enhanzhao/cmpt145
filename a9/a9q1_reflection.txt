1. queue and stack object implementation is similar for the most part, since both uses nodes to store data in FIFO and LIFO
protocol. Methods like size(), is_empty(), peek() and to_string() are almost identical to each other.

2. the difference is in push(), pop(), enqueue() and dequeue(). queue's enqueue and dequeue should consider the front and
back node references depending on if the queue is empty, has 1 data only, or has multiple data. stack on the other hand
only has to worry about its top value, thus push() and pop() methods have less to consider when implementing.

3. The similarity between the 2 classes means problems I had for the first one is already resolved in the second one.
I did have to experiment with how to use the Node class methods when Node is a module in a separate file.
